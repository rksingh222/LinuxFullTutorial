putty allows you to connect windows system to linux system remotely

if you are trying to connect linux from Mac you do not need to install putty

open a terminal on your Mac run following command # ssh -l iafzal(username of linux machine) linuxipaddress

download putty for windows for 64 bit

ifconfig or ip adds – in linux terminal will give me the ip address
